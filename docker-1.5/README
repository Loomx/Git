Docker - Docking System Tray

Copyright (C) 2003  Ben Jansens


What is Docker?

Docker is a docking application (WindowMaker dock app) which acts as a system
tray for KDE3 and GNOME2. It can be used to replace the panel in either
environment, allowing you to have a system tray without running the KDE/GNOME
panel.


What window managers can I use Docker with?

I wrote and designed Docker to work with Openbox 2, but it should work fine in
any window manager that supports WindowMaker dock apps.


Why don't my KDE3 system tray icons show up?

Docker requires a KDE3 compliant window manager to handle KDE3 system tray
icons, and since it is a docking application, the window manager needs to also
support WindowMaker Dock Apps. The only window manager that meets these
requirements to my knowledge is:
 - Openbox 2 (http://icculus.org/openbox)
If you know of any other window managers that support the KDE3 hints for the
system tray and docking apps (i.e. that docker works in), please let me know so
I can add them to this list, and test docker out in them!


Why don't my GNOME2 system tray icons show up?

I don't know! Email me and let me know what application isn't working. (Don't
you dare email me about a GNOME1 application! :)


Who wrote Docker?

Me, of course. That is, Ben Jansens. I can be reached at <ben@orodu.net>. I am
the founder and currently the project head of sorts for the Openbox project.


===============================
|| INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ||
===============================

To install this application, simply do the following:

You can change a couple of things in the Makefile if you want to:
PREFIX defines where the program will be installed to.
