dstatus
=========
dstatus is a simple statusbar for dwm.

It displays the following:

string from /tmp/status_msg | memory % | OSS volume % | battery % | time

If any of the files don't exist, it will silently omit them.

See ../player for /tmp/status_msg


Installation
------------
Edit `Makefile' to match your local setup (dstatus is installed
into the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dstatus
(if necessary as root):

    make install clean
