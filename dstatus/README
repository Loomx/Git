dstatus
=======
dstatus is a simple statusbar for dwm.

It displays the following:

string from /tmp/status_msg | memory % | volume % | battery % | date/time

If any of the files don't exist, it will silently omit them.

If battery level drops below 5% an alert is displayed.

See ../player for /tmp/status_msg & /tmp/mp_pipe


Installation
------------
Edit `Makefile' to match your local setup (dstatus is installed
into the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dstatus
(if necessary as root):

    make install clean
