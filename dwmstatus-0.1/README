dwmstatus
=========
dwmstatus is a simple statusbar for dwm.

It displays the following:

string from /tmp/mp_track | memory usage | int from /tmp/alsa_volume \
| battery charge | time

If any of the files don't exist, it will silently omit them.

See ../scripts/dmplayer for /tmp/mp_track
See ../dwm-6.0/config.h for /tmp/alsa_volume


Installation
------------
Edit `Makefile' to match your local setup (dwmstatus is installed
into the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwmstatus
(if necessary as root):

    make install clean
