dwmstatus
=========

dwmstatus is a simple statusbar for dwm.

It displays the following:

string from /tmp/mp_track | memory usage | int from /tmp/alsa_volume | battery charge | time

If any of the files don't exist, it will silently omit them.

See ../scripts/music for /tmp/mp_track
See ../dwm-6.0/config.h for /tmp/alsa_volume
