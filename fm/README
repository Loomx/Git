fm
==

fm is a small curses-based file browser with a preview pane.
It was first developed as `noice' by lostd and sin, originally to be
used with a TV remote control for a media center solution.


Building
========

To build fm you need a curses implementation available.  In most
cases you just do:

    make


Getting started
===============

Run fm in a directory to display its contents in the form of a list,
The currently selected item will be preceded with a " > " by default.

The selected item will also be shown in the preview pane on the right.
For pdf previews, you need pdftotxt
For doc previews, you need antiword
For docx previews, you need docx2txt
For xls previews, you need xls2csv (comes with `catdoc')


For more information refer to the manpage.
