op
======
A simple file opener in C.


Installation
------------
Edit `Makefile' to match your setup
- default is /usr/local/bin/op

Then build and install player (if necessary as root) e.g.

  # make install clean


Running op
----------
`op filename'

Based on the suffix, op will exec xpdf, libreoffice, geeqie or
(fallthrough option) mplayer to open the file.
