player
======
player is a simple music player in C.

It calls dmenu to select:
    - "Jukebox" mode (shuffle all)
    - "DVD" mode
    - an album from ~/Music
       `- "Play" album
        - "Shuffle" album
        - play a track

It then calls mplayer to play the track(s) and loops to write the
currently playing trackname to /tmp/status_msg


Installation
------------
Edit `Makefile' to match your local setup (player is installed
into the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install player
(if necessary as root):

    make install clean
