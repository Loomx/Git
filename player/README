player
======
A simple music player in C using dmenu and mplayer.


Installation
------------
Edit `Makefile' to match your setup
- default is /usr/local/bin/player

Then build and install player (if necessary as root) e.g.

  # make install clean


Running player
--------------
player assumes your music directory is organised in a simple,
flat layout (which suits dmenu) e.g.

	~/Music/Album-Artist/trackname

When called as `player [...]' it will:

	* Check for arguments and send to mplayer via FIFO
	* Check cache files and update if needed
	* Prompt to choose an album
	* Prompt for filters | mode | trackname
	* Launch mplayer
	* Loop while playing to save current trackname
	* Clean up after mplayer exits
