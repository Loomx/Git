It uses dmenu to select an option:
    - "Jukebox" mode (shuffle all)
    - "DVD" mode
    - album from ~/Music
       `- "Play" album
        - "Shuffle" album
        - a track

It then calls mplayer to play the track(s).

Edit `Makefile' to match your local setup (player is installed
into the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install player
(if necessary as root):
